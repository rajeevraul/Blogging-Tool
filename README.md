A RESTful application made with the express.js framework with a SQLite3 database
=======
#### Installation requirements ####

* NodeJS 
    - follow the install instructions at https://nodejs.org/en/
    - we recommend using the latest LTS version
* Sqlite3 
    - Windows users: follow instructions here https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/
    - Mac users: it comes preinstalled
    - Linux users: use a package manager eg. apt install

To install all the node packages run ```npm install``` from the project directory

#### Help with node SQLite3 ####

A few aspects SQLite3 work a little differently to mySql but all of the key concepts are the same

Find the API documentation at:
https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/wiki/API

Find node SQLite tutorials at:
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/
This also a good resource to find examples and tutorials around SQLite queries

Run ```npm run build-db``` to create the database (database.db)
Run ```npm run start``` to start serving the web app (Access via http://localhost:3000)

You can also run: 
```npm run clean-db``` to delete the database before rebuilding it for a fresh start
NB. we will ONLY run ```npm install```, ```npm run build-db```, and ```npm run start``` . We will NOT install additional packages to run your code and will NOT run additional build scripts. Be careful with any additional node dependencies that you use.
